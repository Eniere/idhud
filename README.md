Eniere's Improved Default HUD version 3.9.2
January 26th, 2022

This is not a custom HUD in its usual meaning, but some fixes for the standard Team Fortress 2 UI such as adding HP numbers on target IDs, reworked Medic UI, popular custom crosshairs and more.
Improved default HUD development is complete. No new features are planned â€” only support for the upcoming major TF2 updates.
