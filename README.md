This is not a custom HUD in its usual meaning, but some fixes for the standard Team Fortress 2 UI such as adding HP numbers on target IDs, reworked Medic UI, popular custom crosshairs and more.
Improved default HUD development is complete. No new features are planned â€” only support for the upcoming major TF2 updates.

Many thanks to all the contributors: @Tiagoquix, @FlaminSarge, @Wormsweat. Special thanks to @Tiagoquix. Since I can no longer actively develop and update IDHUD, his productive help is extremely important.
