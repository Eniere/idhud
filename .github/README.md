Eniere's Improved default HUD ver. 3.9.2
January 26th, 2022

This is not a custom HUD in its usual meaning, but some fixes for standard Team Fortress 2 UI, adding HP numbers on target IDs, reworked Medic UI, popular custom crosshairs, and more.
Improved default HUD development is complete. No new features are planned — only support for the upcoming major TF2 updates.
