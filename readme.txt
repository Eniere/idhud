Hai lads. Finally, after a long time, I make some changes for my HUD. Here it is:

Eniere's Improved default HUD v1.1

So what's new?
— New scoreboard for minmode. Now cl_hudminmode “1” activate the new scoreboard created especially for 6v6.
>!< I don't test 6s scoreboard on resolutions larger than 1366×768, so report if something works wrong.
If you not pleasured with 6s version, just delete scoreboard.res file in HUD /resource/ui folder. Also, if you want 6s table for cl_hudminmode “0” too, just rename “scoreboard.res--only_6s” to “scoreboard.res”.
— cp_badlands wallpaper for main menu. It's appear randomly with 1:4 chance. Just for fun.
— Subtitles will be useful for medics — write “closecaption 1” to console and restart Team Fortress 2 (works only when game AND Steam language is English.)
— Keyboard navigation between Backpack pages (A and D keys.)
— Some important fixes for whole HUD.
