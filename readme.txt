Eniere's Improved default HUD v2.0.1
March 22, 2014

This is not a HUD in its usual meaning — but the some fixes for standart Team fortress 2 HUD, adding HP numbers on target IDs, small ubercharge value label near the crosshair, etc. — see screenshots for more info. I do it for myself, but maybe someone will find it useful too.
